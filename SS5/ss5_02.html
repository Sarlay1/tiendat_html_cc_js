        <p><span class="highlight">Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known
                for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading
                figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as
                Swifties.</span></p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with
            the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and
            "You Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on
            Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the
            synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The
            albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake
            It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".</span></p>
